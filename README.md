# Vanilla Weather App

This front-end project was created as part of the SheCodes Plus Workshop, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The project's primary goal was to create a weather application that allows users to search for weather information in a specific city using an API. Additionally, the app includes a dark mode view function for enhanced user experience.
